# Temperature Controlled Fan (Arduino)

### Overview
The **Temperature Controlled Fan** is an embedded systems project that automatically regulates fan speed based on ambient temperature readings. It is built using **Arduino C++**, featuring real-time sensor data processing and motor control.

### Features
- Automatic temperature-based fan speed adjustment  
- Live temperature and humidity readings displayed on LCD  
- Manual override for fan control  
- Efficient use of interrupts and sensor feedback loops  

### Technologies Used
- **Arduino (C/C++)** for embedded programming  
- **DHT11 Sensor** for temperature and humidity sensing  
- **LCD Display (LiquidCrystal library)** for real-time data output  
- **Arduino IDE** for compilation and deployment  
- **Transistor motor control circuit** for fan actuation  

### Highlights
- Integrates software and hardware for responsive control systems  
- Showcases IoT principles and real-time sensor feedback  
- Strong example of embedded C++ programming and prototyping
